## World Happiness Report
## Overview
The World Happiness Report is a significant survey that assesses global happiness levels and factors contributing to happiness across countries. This README provides an introduction to the report, its methodology, and key insights derived from the data.

## Content
The happiness scores and rankings in the report are derived from the Gallup World Poll. Respondents rate their current life satisfaction on a scale known as the Cantril ladder, ranging from 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life). These scores are based on nationally representative samples from 2013 to 2016, using Gallup weights for accuracy.

## The report analyzes five key factors contributing to happiness:

Economy, 
Health,
Freedom,
Family &
Absence of corruption

These factors are compared to hypothetical values in Dystopia (the worldâ€™s lowest national averages) to understand why some countries rank higher than others.
